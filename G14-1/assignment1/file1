The complete US-ASCII character set is listed in [US-ASCII]. Note that the control characters including DEL (0-31, 127) have no defined meaning apart from the combination CRLF (ASCII values 13 and 10) indicating a new line. Two of the characters have de facto meanings in wide use: FF (12) often means "start subsequent text on the beginning of a new page"; and TAB or HT (9) often (though not always) means "move the cursor to the next available column after the current position where the column number is a multiple of 8 (counting the first column as column 0)." Apart from this, any use of the control characters or DEL in a body must be part of a private agreement between the sender and recipient. Such private agreements are discouraged and should be replaced by the other capabilities of this document. NOTE: Beyond US-ASCII, an enormous proliferation of character sets is possible. It is the opinion of the IETF working group that a large number of character sets is NOT a good thing. We would prefer to specify a single character set that can be used universally for representing all of the world's languages in electronic mail. Unfortunately, existing practice in several communities seems to point to the continued use of multiple character sets in the near future. For this reason, we define names for a small number of character sets for which a strong constituent base exists. It is our hope that ISO 10646 or some other effort will eventually define a single world character set which can then be specified for use in Internet mail, but in the advance of that definition we cannot specify the use of ISO 10646, Unicode, or any other character set whose definition is, as of this writing, incomplete.
