# Concurrent Programming
Welcome to the Concurrent Programming course repository! This course explores advanced topics in concurrent programming, focusing on models of concurrent execution, mutual exclusion problems, synchronization algorithms, hardware synchronization primitives, and classic synchronization problems.

## Course Overview
ECE321 concurrent Programming builds upon fundamental programming concepts, introducing techniques for developing efficient and reliable concurrent software solutions.

## Course Content
The course covers the following topics:

1. Concurrency Model

2. Mutual Exclusion Problem

3. Mutual Exclusion Algorithms at Application Level

4. Hardware Synchronization Primitives

5. Semaphores

6. Classic Synchronization Problems with Semaphores

7. Monitors/Condition Variables

8. Classic Synchronization Problems with Monitors

9. Conditional Critical Regions

10. Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) Model

11. Tuple Space Model

12. Concurrent Programming and Synchronization in C/pthreads and Java

## Getting Started
To get started with the course content, navigate to the respective folders for each topic. You'll find code examples, exercises, and resources to deepen your understanding of concurrent programming concepts. Each folder contains the Assignments of the project, the source code and small presentation of solutions.
1. G14-1: An introduction to get along with pthreads library and threads
2. G14-2: Project using semaphores for synchronization and mutual exclution
3. G14-3: Similar excerises to G14-2 using monitors
4. G14-4: Coroutines, threads and tuple space model
